# Call_Response_Analysis

## Week 1
Added Machine Learning supervised model,[Machine Learning](https://github.com/evanbruno617/Call_Response_Analysis/blob/Evan/machine_learning.ipynb), and I chose to use RandomForestModel due to our focus being on classifying what kind of agents, and what conditions meet the service level (percentage of calls answered versus incoming calls). As of now I will create two models, one for predicting which kind of agents are the most efficient and have the highest service level then creating a model to see what time of day has the lowest and highest service level. This will allow us to see what agents are doing the best and which ones aren't as well as taking into consideration how the time of day effects the service level.
